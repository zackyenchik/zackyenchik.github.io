	<h2>Capsule Killer</h2>

	<div class="section-container">
		<p>Capsule Killer is a first-person shooter developed in Unity
			using C#. Upon starting the game, a capsule (enemy) will spawn
			at a random location every 2-5 seconds. The capsules move 
			towards the player, doing damage upon collision. The player has
			the ability to move around using the WASD keys, jump using the 
			space bar, and shoot using the left mouse button. The goal of 
			the game is to eliminate as many capsules as possible before dying.
			The game has a fully functional main menu and pause menu.
